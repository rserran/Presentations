## Title : **The Magnificent 7 - Intelligent Query Processing**
### Abstract
Can we fix query performance issues without any code changes? Making application changes can be an expensive undertaking. Hence, developers and DBAs want the query processor to adapt to their workload needs vs. using options and trace flags to gain performance. Adaptation is the idea behind Intelligent Query Processing (IQP) in the newer versions of SQL Server. In this demo-heavy presentation, I will walk you through seven intelligent query processing features introduced in SQL 2022, 2019, and 2017. I will help you identify features built on top of Query Store that you must enable in the user database. We will look at the pros and cons of using these features and control them if you are not ready to use them.

By attending this session, you learn the new capabilities of Intelligent Query Processing. You equip yourself with powerful tools to convince your peers to change the database compatibility level to 160 for the Azure SQL Databases or upgrade to SQL Server 2022 for on-premises databases.
