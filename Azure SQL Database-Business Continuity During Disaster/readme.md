## Title : **Azure SQL Database-Business Continuity During Disaster**
### Abstract
Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on the latest version of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. You can build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure. 

While considering Azure SQL Database, two of the most critical questions you need to answer are what are my options for business continuity and how to implement these options? 

In this demo intensive session, I will talk about five specific options and show you how to implement those. You will walk out of this session equipped with knowledge and scripts to implement appropriate High Availability and Disaster Recovery solutions for your Azure SQL Database.
